The function that takes the longest is the bubble_sort function,
with a time of 24.30. This is a massive difference compared to quick_sort,
which only takes 3.30. This can most likely be attributed to how many times
bubble_sort needs to call to the vector in order to work properly. The 
bottleneck in bubble_sort is how many calls it makes to the vector.
